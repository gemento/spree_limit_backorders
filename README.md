Spree / Limit Backorders
===================

When a product/variant is marked as backorderable, spree allows an unlimited number of backorders.

This extenstion allows you set a cap for backorders in the admin.

Usage
-----------

To set the limit:

- Go to Admin -> Products -> Edit -> Stock Locations
- Check off the "Backorderable" option
- Enter a max value (a max zero allows infinite backorders)
- Click "save"


Installation
------------

Add spree_limit_backorders to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_limit_backorders', github: 'joshnuss/spree_limit_backorders'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_limit_backorders:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_limit_backorders/factories'
```
